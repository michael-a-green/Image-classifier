# Image-classifier
Machine-learning model to predict cats and dog from image using  Convolutional Neural Networks.

The convolutional neural networks is more like combination of the biology and the mathematics with little bit computer science. These networks have been some of the most influential innovations in the computer vision. This neural network used to win the ImageNet competition in the year of 2012 and it recorded error up to 26% - 15%. This was the outstanding improvement of that time. Because of this reason, many companies have been using deep learning at the core of their services. Facebook uses neural nets for their automatic tagging algorithms and google uses for photo search. Like Pinterest for their home feed personalization and the instant gram for their infrastructure.

# Implementation:

I have implemented convolutional neural network that is able to differentiate between all the images it is given and figure out the unique features that makes a dog or a cat. When we look at a picture of cat, we can classify by seeing paws or legs. When it comes to the machine, is able perform
image classification by looking for low level features such as edges and curves, and then building up to more abstract concepts through a series of convolutional layers. This is a general overview of what a CNN does.
